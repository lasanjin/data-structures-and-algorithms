# Data Structures
Lab assignments during data structures course at Chalmers.

## Description

### lab2
The purpose of this assignment was to test efficiency of different implementations of collections, more specifically:

- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- Sorted Linked List
- Splay Tree

### lab3
The purpose of this assignment was to practice implementing and understanding algorithms with linked structures, more specifically a variety of Graph algorithms such as Dijkstras and Kruskals algorithm.

We were given a route network (the tram network in Gothenburg), and had to write an algorithm to calculate the most efficient path given a start- and end-stop.
